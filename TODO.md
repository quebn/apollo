Apollo should be able to do these things:
- [ ] Music Player
  - [x] accept file, directory, or title to play music.
  - [ ] autoplay the next song in the playlist and print the title.
  - [ ] introduce keybinds(?) to control the music player within the command line.
  - [ ] introduce persitent data like: playlist, music lists, data of the last play song/playlist.
- [ ] Make it a semi HTTP server and use REST to make control and serve its music to others over the network.
- [ ] Convert Apollo to a daemon which make it that calling the program again with commands invoke the ff. action to the daemon.
  - [ ] `start`: start the daemon explicitly.
  - [ ] `kill`: kills the program daemon if there is one.
  - [ ] `next`: plays the next song in the playlist.
  - [ ] `prev`: plays the previous song in the playlist.
  - [ ] `toggle`: pause or resume the current song.
  - [ ] `stop`: stops to current song.
  - [ ] `list`: lists all the song of the current playlist.
